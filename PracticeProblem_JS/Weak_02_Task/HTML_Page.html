    <div style="background-color: lightyellow; padding: 20px; border: 1px dashed grey;">
        <p>This pen is part of <a
                href="https://www.zachgollwitzer.com/posts/2021/fullstack-developer-series/7-html-css-crash-course/">lesson
                7</a> of my fullstack web dev series.</p>
        <p>Don't worry about how I styled this block of text yet. We'll get there later in the lesson! ☺️</p>
    </div>

    <!-- SECTION 1
  
          CONTENT TAGS
  
      -->
    <h1>h1 element (often used for page titles)</h1>
    <h2>h2 element (often used as main section titles)</h2>
    <h3>h3 element (subheading)</h3>
    <h4>h4 element (subheading)</h4>
    <h5>h5 element (subheading - I rarely use these)</h5>
    <h6>h6 element (subheading - not sure that I have ever used this)</h6>
    <p>p (paragraph) element - this is probably the most commonly used HTML element and represents the main text on a
        webpage</p>



    <p>We will use the h2 tag as the heading for each additional section here. Also, read the code to see how I'm
        creating this horizontal divider line below (hint: the "hr" tag!)</p>

    <!-- "Horizontal rule": useful for page separation -->
    <hr>

    <!-- SECTION 2
  
          MORE CONTENT TAGS
  
      -->

    <h2>div, span, strong, em, a, img, button</h2>

    <p>Here is a <span style="color: red;">span element</span>, which is often used within a p tag to isolate and style
        a particular piece of text. I have added a "style" attribute to it in the code, but we will cover how that works
        later. And here is a <strong>bold element (the "strong" tag)</strong>, and an <em>italicized element (the "em"
            tag)</em>.

    <div>You could put normal text in a div element like this...</div>

    <div style="border: 1px dashed black; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 10px;">
        <p>But most of the time, you will nest an element within the div so that it can be styled like this (again,
            don't worry about how these styles are working yet)</p>
    </div>

    <a href="https://www.zachgollwitzer.com" target="_blank">Here's a link to my site. For this tag, the "href" attribute is
        required</a>

    <p>Here are some input tags. This allows a user to enter data. This is a self-closing tag and some common attributes
        that you will use in it are "name", "placeholder", and "value". Try typing into each of them.</p>

    <input name="input1" />
    <input name="input1" placeholder="here is a placeholder" />
    <input name="input1" value="here is a pre-defined value" />

    <p>And here's an img (image) tag. The "src" attribute is required. I also added the "width" attribute to make it
        smaller to fit on this page.</p>

    <img src="https://i.insider.com/5484d9d1eab8ea3017b17e29" width="100" />

    <button>Click me</button>

    <p>The button above won't do anything (we need JavaScript for that), but you will use buttons ALL THE TIME in web
        programming, so learn them well!</p>

    <!-- SECTION 3
  
          LIST TAGS
  
      -->

    <h2>Lists</h2>

    <h3>Unordered List (ul tag)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
        <li>Item 3</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Ordered List (ol tag)</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
        <li>Item 3</li>
    </ol>

    <!-- SECTION 4
  
          TABLE TAGS
  
      -->

    <h2>Tables</h2>
    <p>Below is an unstyled HTML table. You won't use tables that often, but I suggest using a <a href="">table
            generator like this one</a> when you do use them as it will save you a TON of time.</p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Heading 1</th>
            <th>Heading 2</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Data 1</td>
            <td>Data 2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Data 3</td>
            <td>Data 4</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
